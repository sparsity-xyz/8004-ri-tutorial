# Sparsity Trustless Agents Framework.

<p align="center">üöÄ Reference Implementation of TEE Registry in <a href="https://8004.org">ERC-8004</a></p>

## üìò Overview

<a href="https://8004.org">ERC-8004</a> defines trustless agents in the Ethereum ecosystem. An important component in 8004 is the validation registry. Validation ensures the integrity of agents through economic-staking or TEE. This repo provides a tutorial on building 8004 agents using TEE on the Sparsity reference implementation. For a deep dive into the 8004 registry design, please see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/127pkxlBE0048N-MNsX66Ctz5dmRxHvaJRASAr01EVVc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x6rb197jqjog).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Sparsity Trustless Agents Framework enables developers to build and deploy TEE agents that can be registered and validated on-chain. 

On-Chain TEE registry contract serves as the central point for registering and validating TEE agents. It stores information about registered agents, including their metadata, validation status, and associated ZK proofs.

Note that one field here is the `codeMeasurement`. It can be thought of as a hash of the agent's codebase. This needs to be published on-chain so that the agent user can use it to verify the integrity of the agent. To facilitate this, the agent developer must publish the agent code somewhere so that anyone in the world can deterministically reproduce the `codeMeasurement` from the source code. 

Currently, the smart contract is deployed on Base Sepolia. You can also use our [TEE Agent Explorer](http://18.144.124.66:8080/) to explore registered agents.

Or you can explore the contract [here](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xe718aec274E36781F18F42C363A3B516a4427637) on-chain directly. See more details in [TEE Agent Registry Contract](docs/TEE_Agent_Registry.md).

## ‚ö° Quick start

The simplest way to get started is to build your agent from our reference implementation. You can follow the steps below to build, deploy, validate, and register your own TEE agent.

  - [0. Pre-requisites: AWS Nitro Enclaves Environment](#0-pre-requisites-aws-nitro-enclaves-environment)
  - [1. Fork & Clone](#1-fork--clone)
  - [2. Edit .env for Nitro Enclave Runtime and Base Sepolia Setup](#2-edit-env-for-nitro-enclave-runtime-and-base-sepolia-setup)
  - [3. Edit Agent Code](#3-edit-agent-code)
  - [4. Build & Deploy Your Agent](#4-build--deploy-your-agent)
  - [5. Request ZK Proof of Your Agent](#5-request-zk-proof-of-your-agent)
  - [6. Register & Validate Your Agent](#6-register--validate-your-agent)
  - [7. Explore Agents](#7-explore-agents)

### 0. Pre-requisites: AWS Nitro Enclaves Environment

Before using Sparsity's offerings, ensure you have an AWS Nitro Enclaves environment set up. The easiest way is to apply for our free lab environment.

**Sparsity Lab Environment**

For participants in "Sparsity Workshop", you can apply for a lab environment by submitting this form:

- Lab environment application: https://tinyurl.com/sparsity-8004-lab

You will receive an email with the necessary details to start your tutorial shortly.

**Build your own AWS Nitro Enclave environment**

You can also setup your own AWS Nitro Enclaves environment. Please see [AWS_Nitro_Enclave_Runtime.md](docs/AWS_Nitro_Enclave_Runtime.md) for details.


### 1. Fork & Clone

Fork this repo to your own GitHub account, then clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-space]]/8004-ri-tutorial --depth=1
```

### 2. Edit .env for Nitro Enclave Runtime and Base Sepolia Setup

```bash
cd 8004-ri-tutorial
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Please fill in the required values in `.env` as described in the file. 

If you have submitted the lab environment application form, you will receive the necessary details via email.

### 3. Edit Agent Code

You need to change `src/agent.json` to customize your agent, so that your agent can be identified on-chain.

```json
{
  "name": "[Your Agent Name]",
  "description": "[Your description here]",
  "code_repository": "https://github.com/[your-username]/sparsity-trustless-agents-framework",
}
```

You can also modify other files in the `src/` directory to implement your own agent logic.

NOTE: There is a "/chat" endpoint in the agent code that your agent can integrate with OpenAI. If you want to test this endpoint, make sure you have set up the OpenAI API key in your `src/.env` file (different from the main `.env` file).

```bash
cp src/.env.example src/.env
nano src/.env
```

### 4. Build & Deploy Your Agent

If you have modified the agent code, please make sure you have tested locally with Docker first.

```bash
./scripts/build-and-deploy-local.sh
```

After that, you can deploy your agent to the EC2 Nitro Enclave by running:

```bash
./scripts/build-and-deploy-remote.sh
```
If everything goes well, you should see output like below:

```
...
==> Running enclave in debug mode
Start allocating memory...
Started enclave with enclave-cid: 16, memory: 4096 MiB, cpu-ids: [1, 3]
{
  "EnclaveName": "demo-agent",
  "EnclaveID": "i-0f881432b6288ad0f-enc199cc4a57a29c28",
  "ProcessID": 28667,
  "EnclaveCID": 16,
  "NumberOfCPUs": 2,
  "CPUIDs": [
    1,
    3
  ],
  "MemoryMiB": 4096
}
[OK] Enclave launch command executed
==> Generating curl command for enclave API (/agent.json)
[INFO] You can invoke the enclave endpoint with:
  curl -s http://[EC2_HOST]/agent.json | jq
[OK] Deployment workflow completed
```

Then you can play with your agent!

```bash
export AGENT_URL=[your-ec2-public-ip]

curl -s http://$AGENT_URL/agent.json | jq

curl -X POST http://$AGENT_URL/add_two \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"a": 2, "b": 2}'

# Requires OpenAI API key to be set in /src/.env before build and deploy
curl -X POST http://$AGENT_URL/chat \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "What is 2+2?"}'

```



### 5. Request ZK Proof of Your Agent

After deployment, you can request a ZK proof of your agent by running:

```bash
./scripts/attest-and-prove.sh
```

It will take around 60 seconds to generate the ZK proof. The proof file will be saved in the ./scripts/ directory. If successful, you should see output like below:

```
...
[OK] Proof ready (elapsed 65s)
[OK] Saved proof to proof_c929d31acdd3cf31_20251010041858969.json
[OK] Proof file structure validated

==> Summary
[INFO] Directory: c929d31acdd3cf31_20251010041858969
[INFO] Elapsed: 65s
[INFO] Output: proof_c929d31acdd3cf31_20251010041858969.json
[NEXT] Next: ./scripts/validate-and-register-agent.sh --proof-path proof_c929d31acdd3cf31_20251010041858969.json 
```

### 6. Register & Validate Your Agent

We use the generated proof file to register and validate your agent on-chain. Run:

```bash
./scripts/validate-and-register-agent.sh --proof-path [proof_generated_from_previous_step.json]
```

NOTE: you can just copy the command from the output of the previous step.

You should see output like below:

```
[OK] Agent validated successfully
[INFO] Agent ID (uint256): 25
[INFO] Agent ID (hex): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000019
==> Summary
[INFO] Elapsed: 1s
[INFO] Registry: 0xe718aec274E36781F18F42C363A3B516a4427637
[INFO] Agent URL: 3.101.88.86
[INFO] Proof: proof_c929d31acdd3cf31_20251010041858969.json
[INFO] Next: Update agent metadata / publish discovery record if required
==> Explorer references
[NEXT] Contract:    https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xe718aec274E36781F18F42C363A3B516a4427637
[NEXT] Agent ID (uint256): 25
```

Now your agent is registered and validated on-chain! 

You can verify the signature in agent's response by:

```bash
pip install -r ./scripts/verifier/requirements.txt
export AGENT_ID=[your_agent_id]
python3 ./scripts/verifier/verify.py --agent-id=$AGENT_ID --url-path=/hello_world
python3 ./scripts/verifier/verify.py --agent-id=$AGENT_ID --url-path=/add_two --data='{"a": 1, "b": 2}'
```
